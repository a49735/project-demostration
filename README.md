# Project Demostration
The SMU quantitative finance school project codes are demostrated here. Although all the projects are required to be finished in groups, the uploaded projects are predominately finished by myself. The projects are closely related to industry practices hence the skills developed during the learning processes could be directly applied in industry.
## Quantitative trading strategies
This project is based on Quantopian platform, which has a robust backtesting system to assess the profitability of the strategies. The trading universe for the strategies are US equities. The main trading framework is factor investing but it is called quantmental as it uses company fundamental factors in a quantitative trading context. The factor selection started from the 65 mostly well-cited factors in academics, and finished with 23 factors (some are compressed into single composite factor), which all passed the Alphenlens(Quantopian builtin factor analysis method)robustness tests. The factors cover the pespectives of quality, profitability, value, efficiency, safety and behavioural economics to maximize the diversification benefits. Fundamental factors are combined linearly but momentum is also used but combined nonlinearly. Conditional on those stocks perform well on fundamental factors, the momentum factor is used to pick up stocks among those stocks with good fundamental scores. Volatility will be a negative sign to rank stocks but will become a postive sign when volatility factor portfolios exhibit  statistically significant return momentum. The treatments towards volatility and momentum are based on researches which indicate the regime switching properties of the two factors.

Based on similar principles, one long only strategy and other three long short equity strategies, momentum weighted, equal weighted and cosine similarity(correlation) weighted are developed. The best performing strategy, cosine similarity LSE, which weights factors based on factor correlation, achieved 12% annualized return with 0.94 Sharpe ratio after transaction fees during the 13-year backtesting period. Around 50% of returns of the strategy come from specific sources.
